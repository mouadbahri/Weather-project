# Weather

This is an api that gets data from Openweathermap and stores it in your own database.

Make sure to change your app_id in Weather.get_weather_url(). You can get one for free once you sign up in Openweathermap.org
Then change the list of places you want to get data for in Weather.locations()

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
